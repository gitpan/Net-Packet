Net::Packet
===========

This module is a unified framework to craft, send and receive packets at 
layers 2, 3, 4 and 7.

Basically, you forge each layer of a frame (Net::Packet::IPv4 for layer 3, 
Net::Packet::TCP for layer 4 ; for example), and pack all of this into a 
Net::Packet::Frame object. Then, you can send the frame to the network, 
and receive it easily, since the response is automatically searched for 
and matched against the request.

*** This framework is obsolete. Use Net::Frame::* now.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Perl v5.6.1
  Class::Gomor
  Net::Pcap
  Net::Write
  Net::Libdnet

GETTING HELP

*** No more help will be provided. Use Net::Frame::* now.

LIMITATIONS

Does NOT work under big endian architecture.

Performances (memory usage, object creation speed) may be quite limited 
for now. I will work on it in the near (or not) future. So this module 
can only handle a few thousand packets on a 512MB RAM machine. Since 
Net::Packet 3.00, performances are better, with some memory optimizations.
