   - FreeBSD 6.0 - Perl 5.8.7 - libpcap 0.9.1
   - Linux 2.6.x - Perl 5.8.5 - libpcap 0.8.3 (Gentoo)
   - Cygwin - Windows XP SP2 - Perl 5.8.5 (not all functions were tested)

Net::Packet is now part of the following systems/distributions:

   - NetBSD pkgsrc
   - FreeBSD ports collection
   - DragonFly ports collection
   - Mandrake/Mandriva RPMs
   - OpenPKG system

Net::Packet
===========

This module is a unified framework to craft, send and receive packets at 
layers 2, 3, 4 and 7.

Basically, you forge each layer of a frame (Net::Packet::IPv4 for layer 3, 
Net::Packet::TCP for layer 4 ; for example), and pack all of this into a 
Net::Packet::Frame object. Then, you can send the frame to the network, and 
receive it easily, since the response is automatically searched for and 
matched against the request.

If you want some layer 2, 3 or 4 protocol encoding/decoding to be added, just 
ask, and give a corresponding .pcap file ;)

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

  Perl v5.6.1
  Class::Gomor
  Net::IPv6Addr
  Net::Pcap
  Socket6
  Time::HiRes
  Bit::Vector
  Net::Write

GETTING HELP

A mailing list is available for all questions concerning Net::Packet, just 
send a message to netpacket-users@gomor.org (this is a moderated list).

LIMITATIONS

Does NOT work under big endian architecture.

If auto* subs do not work, you will need to set $Env->dev, $Env->ip, $Env->mac 
manually for each of your Net::Packet programs.

Performances (memory usage, object creation speed) maye be quite limited for 
now. I will work on it in the near (or not) future. So this module can only 
handle a few thousand packets on a 512MB RAM machine.
